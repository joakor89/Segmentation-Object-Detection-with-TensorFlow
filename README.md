# Segmentation & Object Detection Project with TensorFlow

There are 3 differente projects related with the main topics
about semntation and object detection process on Computer Vision.

Models were performed at Google Colab Platform due to GPU constrains

I strongly suggest you to perform it there as well. Unless you've got
a remarkable Desktop or Laptop. 

# Object Detection 

```sh
It was directly built up on Google Colab
Images used for this project could be found in
image-video folder. 

Feel free to used whichever fit the best for you!
```
# Object Detection II

```sh
Final Object Detection
Dataset was retrieved from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alincijov/self-driving-cars

Download it on .Zip format & performed at Google Colab
```

# Segmentation

```sh
Segmentation Dataset was retrieved from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection
Download it on .Zip format & performed at Google Colab
```
